🩺 CardioGuard: Harnessing Machine Learning for Blood Pressure Analysis

A Flask-based web application that predicts a person's blood pressure stage (e.g., Normal, Hypertension Stage 1/2, Crisis) based on basic health inputs, using a trained ML model. The app also allows users to download the results as a PDF report.


🔍 Project Overview
CardioGuard is a machine learning project that helps estimate a user's blood pressure category from clinical features like age group, gender, systolic & diastolic BP, and other symptoms.
Key Features:

Interactive web UI using Flask + HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)
Trained SVM-based ML model for BP classification
Client-side PDF generation using jsPDF
Clean and responsive design
Lightweight and easy to deploy


🧠 How It Works

User visits the homepage and enters basic medical inputs through a form.
Model predicts the blood pressure stage (e.g., Normal, Crisis).
Advice is shown based on the prediction.
Download button allows saving the result as a PDF report.
